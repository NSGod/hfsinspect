The following changes are automagically-generated from the commit history.  Subtle hints of frustration may be apparent at times.

0.1.0 / 2013-06-04
==================

 * Finished volume header.
 * Some work on generalizing the I/O.
 * YAY! KEYED RECORDS!
 * Fixed a lot of issues with reading records in nodes and byte-swapping on node read.
 * Search is fixed. File path lookups work. Whirled peas.

0.2.0 / 2013-06-25
==================

 * Round 300 of trying to get extent reading right.
 * Renaming some things, including licenses.
 * Lots of progress.
 * Adding in basic README
 * Cleaned up help; fixed output permissions; moved journal out to its own option.
 * Standardized some memory calls.
 * Added metric measures to sizeString.
 * Adding hfs_read_range function.
 * Adding some support for HFS structures; made some logging statements public.
 * Redid some logic in main; added GPT and HFS detection support.
 * Made fork size data a top-tier property (prep for HFS).
 * Adding some stat structs to the volume.
 * Switch to array math for extent swapping.
 * Try to detect GPT/HFS formats.
 * Be a little smarter about block sizes on raw devices; fixed an extent record swap bug.
 * More GPT partition IDs; fixed reading inside an HFS wrapper partition.

0.2.1 / 2013-07-10
==================

 * Update README.md with waffle.io badge
 * Merge pull request #11 from waffleio/master
 * Fixes #12 and #13.
 * Adding Travis support. (Maybe.)
 * Updating Travis support.

0.3.0 / 2013-12-05
==================

 * Updated GPT partition parsing to handle 512b or 4K-block drives.
 * Initialize the block count variable. Turns out that matters.
 * added support for proper volumes and documentation
 * Starting process of abstracting the volume I/O from the filesystem logic.
 * Moved the core endian-ness logic into _endian.h for porting.
 * Moved core output logic into output.h for abstraction.
 * Cleaned up includes.
 * Integrated the new partition/volume logic into the HFS code.
 * Started adding doc-comments.
 * Included doxygen config.
 * Cleaned up hexdumper.
 * Major work on partitions, Core Storage, memory use, and hex dumps.
 * Color-coded hex dumps.
 * Updating logging mechanism. Including work-in-progress btree implementation that attempts to divorce it from knowledge of specific HFS datatypes.
 * With a freshly-broken btree implementation (working on it) comes make support. Yay!
 * Now compiling on Linux! (How does anything run on that platform?) Sample test images. Tests to come. Better GPT partition detection.
 * A better, unified makefile. Basic tests.
 * Rename Makefile.DARWIN to Makefile.Darwin
 * Rename Makefile.LINUX to Makefile.Linux
 * I think I finally got the Travis support going…
 * Reorganized the Makefile and project to better support multi-OS testing.
 * Included a Vagrantfile for a Linux machine similar to the Travis CI machine.
 * Congratulations! It's a manpage!
 * starting to add FS extract option
 * Added clang script. Started hotfiles support. Created function to convert a path into a catalog record (about time).
 * work on fs yank
 * Added some compiler metadata. More work on hot files. General tweaking.
 * updated docs
 * catalog modernization work

0.3.1 / 2014-03-28
==================

 * Removed deprecated catalog function.
 * Added parsing of btree node allocation maps.
 * Xcode project tweaks to not install every time.
 * Don’t trust the on-disk data in the trees as much.
 * Added --si flag to use SI decimal prefixes. Defaults to binary (1024).
 * Endian cleanup.
 * Allocation file support.
 * Freespace/extents reporting (-0/--freespace).
 * Endian simplification.
 * Now checking GPT CRCs. Various safeties for corrupt partition tables.

0.3.2 / 2014-04-02
==================

 * Added support for APM volumes with 512, 1K, or 2K block sizes. Better memory handling in some places (more to come). Better GPT detection.
 * Cleaned up some parts of the Linux build.  Now requires libbsd for strlcpy/strlcat.
 * Some GPT fixes for Linux x64.
 * Updated Travis config.
 * Travis config consolidation.
 * Elusive GCC swap errors, begone!
 * Moved main.c operations out into distinct files.
 * Cleaned up critical() a little.
 * Fixed case where a Volume's block size was unreasonably large for an image file.
 * Moved some type declarations around.
 * Added a build test script.
 * Using FREE macro more.
 * Removed stale includes.
 * Fixed some errors when running on 32-bit Linux.
 * Changed Makefile because Travis is using an ancient gunzip.
